    Added support for comments on :class:`.Constraint` objects, including
    DDL and reflection; the field is added to the base :class:`.Constraint`
    class and corresponding constructors, however PostgreSQL is the only
    included backend to support the feature right now.
    See parameters such as :paramref:`.ForeignKeyConstraint.comment`,
    :paramref:`.UniqueConstraint.comment` or
    :paramref:`.CheckConstraint.comment`.
