    Full "RETURNING" support is implemented for the cx_Oracle dialect, covering
    two individual types of functionality:

    * multi-row RETURNING is implemented, meaning multiple RETURNING rows are
      now received for DML statements that produce more than one row for
      RETURNING.
    * "executemany RETURNING" is also implemented - this allows RETURNING to
      yield row-per statement when ``cursor.executemany()`` is used.
      The implementation of this part of the feature delivers dramatic
      performance improvements to ORM inserts, in the same way as was
      added for psycopg2 in the SQLAlchemy 1.4 change :ref:`change_5263`.

    cx_Oracle 7 is now the minimum version for cx_Oracle.
