    :tags: feature, orm
    :tickets: 8126

    Added very experimental feature to the :func:`_orm.selectinload` and
    :func:`_orm.immediateload` loader options called
    :paramref:`_orm.selectinload.recursion_depth` /
    :paramref:`_orm.immediateload.recursion_depth` , which allows a single
    loader option to automatically recurse into self-referential relationships.
    Is set to an integer indicating depth, and may also be set to -1 to
    indicate to continue loading until no more levels deep are found.
    Major internal changes to :func:`_orm.selectinload` and
    :func:`_orm.immediateload` allow this feature to work while continuing
    to make correct use of the compilation cache, as well as not using
    arbitrary recursion, so any level of depth is supported (though would
    emit that many queries).  This may be useful for
    self-referential structures that must be loaded fully eagerly, such as when
    using asyncio.

    A warning is also emitted when loader options are connected together with
    arbitrary lengths (that is, without using the new ``recursion_depth``
    option) when excessive recursion depth is detected in related object
    loading. This operation continues to use huge amounts of memory and
    performs extremely poorly; the cache is disabled when this condition is
    detected to protect the cache from being flooded with arbitrary statements.
