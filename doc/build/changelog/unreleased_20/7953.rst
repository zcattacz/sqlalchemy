    Fixed issue in :meth:`.Result.columns` method where calling upon
    :meth:`.Result.columns` with a single index could in some cases,
    particularly ORM result object cases, cause the :class:`.Result` to yield
    scalar objects rather than :class:`.Row` objects, as though the
    :meth:`.Result.scalars` method had been called. In SQLAlchemy 1.4, this
    scenario emits a warning that the behavior will change in SQLAlchemy 2.0.
