    Added new parameter to SQLite for reflection methods called
    ``sqlite_include_internal=True``; when omitted, local tables that start
    with the prefix ``sqlite_``, which per SQLite documentation are noted as
    "internal schema" tables such as the ``sqlite_sequence`` table generated to
    support "AUTOINCREMENT" columns, will not be included in reflection methods
    that return lists of local objects. This prevents issues for example when
    using Alembic autogenerate, which previously would consider these
    SQLite-generated tables as being remove from the model.
