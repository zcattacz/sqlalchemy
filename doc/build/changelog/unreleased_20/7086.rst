.. change::
    :tags: bug, postgresql
    :tickets: 7086

    The :meth:`.Operators.match` operator now uses ``plainto_tsquery()`` for
    PostgreSQL full text search, rather than ``to_tsquery()``. The rationale
    for this change is to provide better cross-compatibility with match on
    other database backends.    Full support for all PostgreSQL full text
    functions remains available through the use of :data:`.func` in
    conjunction with :meth:`.Operators.bool_op` (an improved version of
    :meth:`.Operators.op` for boolean operators).
