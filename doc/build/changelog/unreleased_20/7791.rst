    The :paramref:`.Enum.length` parameter, which sets the length of the
    ``VARCHAR`` column for non-native enumeration types, is now used
    unconditionally when emitting DDL for the ``VARCHAR`` datatype, including
    when the :paramref:`.Enum.native_enum` parameter is set to ``True`` for
    target backends that continue to use ``VARCHAR``. Previously the parameter
    would be erroneously ignored in this case. The warning previously emitted
    for this case is now removed.
