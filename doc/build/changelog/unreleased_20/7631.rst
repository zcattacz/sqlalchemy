    Expanded on the "conditional DDL" system implemented by the
    :class:`_schema.ExecutableDDLElement` class (renamed from
    :class:`_schema.DDLElement`) to be directly available on
    :class:`_schema.SchemaItem` constructs such as :class:`_schema.Index`,
    :class:`_schema.ForeignKeyConstraint`, etc. such that the conditional logic
    for generating these elements is included within the default DDL emitting
    process. This system can also be accommodated by a future release of
    Alembic to support conditional DDL elements within all schema-management
    systems.
