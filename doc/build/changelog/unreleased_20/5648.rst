    The :meth:`.DialectEvents.handle_error` event is now moved to the
    :class:`.DialectEvents` suite from the :class:`.EngineEvents` suite, and
    now participates in the connection pool "pre ping" event for those dialects
    that make use of disconnect codes in order to detect if the database is
    live. This allows end-user code to alter the state of "pre ping". Note that
    this does not include dialects which contain a native "ping" method such as
    that of psycopg2 or most MySQL dialects.
