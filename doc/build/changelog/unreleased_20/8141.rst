    Added parameter :paramref:`_ddl.DropConstraint.if_exists` to the
    :class:`_ddl.DropConstraint` construct which result in "IF EXISTS" DDL
    being added to the DROP statement.
    This phrase is not accepted by all databases and the operation will fail
    on a database that does not support it as there is no similarly compatible
    fallback within the scope of a single DDL statement.
