    Add support for Partitioning and Sample pages on MySQL and MariaDB
    reflected options.
    The options are stored in the table dialect options dictionary, so
    the following keyword need to be prefixed with ``mysql_`` or ``mariadb_``
    depending on the backend.
    Supported options are:

    * ``stats_sample_pages``
    * ``partition_by``
    * ``partitions``
    * ``subpartition_by``

    These options are also reflected when loading a table from database,
    and will populate the table :attr:`_schema.Table.dialect_options`.
