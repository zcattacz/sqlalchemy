    The in-place type detection for Python integers, as occurs with an
    expression such as ``literal(25)``, will now apply value-based adaption as
    well to accommodate Python large integers, where the datatype determined
    will be :class:`.BigInteger` rather than :class:`.Integer`. This
    accommodates for dialects such as that of asyncpg which both sends implicit
    typing information to the driver as well as is sensitive to numeric scale.
