    Adds support for PostgreSQL multirange types, introduced in PostgreSQL 14.
    Support for PostgreSQL ranges and multiranges has now been generalized to
    the psycopg3, psycopg2 and asyncpg backends, with room for further dialect
    support, using a backend-agnostic :class:`_postgresql.Range` data object
    that's constructor-compatible with the previously used psycopg2 object. See
    the new documentation for usage patterns.

    Thanks very much to @zeeeeeb for the pull request implementing and testing
    the new datatypes and psycopg support.
