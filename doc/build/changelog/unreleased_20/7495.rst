    The behavior of :func:`_orm.defer` regarding primary key and "polymorphic
    discriminator" columns is revised such that these columns are no longer
    deferrable, either explicitly or when using a wildcard such as
    ``defer('*')``. Previously, a wildcard deferral would not load
    PK/polymorphic columns which led to errors in all cases, as the ORM relies
    upon these columns to produce object identities. The behavior of explicit
    deferral of primary key columns is unchanged as these deferrals already
    were implicitly ignored.
