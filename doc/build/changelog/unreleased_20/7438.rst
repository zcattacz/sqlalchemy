    Fixed bug in the behavior of the :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.eager_defaults`
    parameter such that client-side SQL default or onupdate expressions in the
    table definition alone will trigger a fetch operation using RETURNING or
    SELECT when the ORM emits an INSERT or UPDATE for the row. Previously, only
    server side defaults established as part of table DDL and/or server-side
    onupdate expressions would trigger this fetch, even though client-side SQL
    expressions would be included when the fetch was rendered.
