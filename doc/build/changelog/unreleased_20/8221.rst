    Oracle will now use FETCH FIRST N ROWS / OFFSET syntax for limit/offset
    support by default for Oracle 12c and above. This syntax was already
    available when :meth:`_sql.Select.fetch` were used directly, it's now
    implied for :meth:`_sql.Select.limit` and :meth:`_sql.Select.offset` as
    well.
