    Added new backend-agnostic :class:`_types.Uuid` datatype generalized from
    the PostgreSQL dialects to now be a core type, as well as migrated
    :class:`_types.UUID` from the PostgreSQL dialect. The SQL Server
    :class:`_mssql.UNIQUEIDENTIFIER` datatype also becomes a UUID-handling
    datatype. Thanks to Trevor Gross for the help on this.
