    Altered the compilation mechanics of the :class:`_dml.Insert` construct
    such that the "autoincrement primary key" column value will be fetched via
    ``cursor.lastrowid`` or RETURNING even if present in the parameter set or
    within the :meth:`_dml.Insert.values` method as a plain bound value, for
    single-row INSERT statements on specific backends that are known to
    generate autoincrementing values even when explicit NULL is passed. This
    restores a behavior that was in the 1.3 series for both the use case of
    separate parameter set as well as :meth:`_dml.Insert.values`. In 1.4, the
    parameter set behavior unintentionally changed to no longer do this, but
    the :meth:`_dml.Insert.values` method would still fetch autoincrement
    values up until 1.4.21 where :ticket:`6770` changed the behavior yet again
    again unintentionally as this use case was never covered.

    The behavior is now defined as "working" to suit the case where databases
    such as SQLite, MySQL and MariaDB will ignore an explicit NULL primary key
    value and nonetheless invoke an autoincrement generator.
