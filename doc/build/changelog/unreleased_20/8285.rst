    :tickets: 8285

    Added new syntax to the :attr:`.FromClause.c` collection on all
    :class:`.FromClause` objects allowing tuples of keys to be passed to
    ``__getitem__()``, along with support for the :func:`_sql.select` construct
    to handle the resulting tuple-like collection directly, allowing the syntax
    ``select(table.c['a', 'b', 'c'])`` to be possible. The sub-collection
    returned is itself a :class:`.ColumnCollection` which is also directly
    consumable by :func:`_sql.select` and similar now.
