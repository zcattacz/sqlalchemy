    The FROM clauses that are established on a :func:`_sql.select` construct
    when using the :meth:`_sql.Select.select_from` method will now render first
    in the FROM clause of the rendered SELECT, which serves to maintain the
    ordering of clauses as was passed to the :meth:`_sql.Select.select_from`
    method itself without being affected by the presence of those clauses also
    being mentioned in other parts of the query. If other elements of the
    :class:`_sql.Select` also generate FROM clauses, such as the columns clause
    or WHERE clause, these will render after the clauses delivered by
    :meth:`_sql.Select.select_from` assuming they were not explictly passed to
    :meth:`_sql.Select.select_from` also. This improvement is useful in those
    cases where a particular database generates a desirable query plan based on
    a particular ordering of FROM clauses and allows full control over the
    ordering of FROM clauses.
