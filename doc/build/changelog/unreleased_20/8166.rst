    Made an improvement to the "deferred" / "load_only" set of strategy options
    where if a certain object is loaded from two different logical paths within
    one query, attributes that have been configured by at least one of the
    options to be populated will be populated in all cases, even if other load
    paths for that same object did not set this option. previously, it was
    based on randomness as to which "path" addressed the object first.
