    SQLite datetime, date, and time datatypes now use Python standard lib
    ``fromisoformat()`` methods in order to parse incoming datetime, date, and
    time string values. This improves performance vs. the previous regular
    expression-based approach, and also automatically accommodates for datetime
    and time formats that contain either a six-digit "microseconds" format or a
    three-digit "milliseconds" format.
